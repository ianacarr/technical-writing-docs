				Once the laptop is charged, open it and locate the power button on the device (usually at the top right of the keyboard) 
				and hold until the laptop powers on. It may take a few minutes to start up.
				<br><br>
				Once it boots, follow the on-screen instructions and configure the device settings. You may need to create a Microsoft account.
